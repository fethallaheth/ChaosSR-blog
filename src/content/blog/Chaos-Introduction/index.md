## Hello

Salam Alikoum `hello`, and welcome to **Chaos SR**! This is my space to share everything Iâ€™m passionate about in blockchain ,smart contract development, security auditing, and analyzing trends in decentralized technology, and many more.

## Who Am I?  
Iâ€™m a **smart contract auditor** and developer specializing in **Solidity** and **Move**. My work focuses on building secure decentralized systems, auditing protocols, and diving into blockchain data to uncover meaningful insights.  

Beyond coding, I love sharing knowledge. Whether itâ€™s tutorials, deep dives, or analyzing blockchain trends, this blog is my way of contributing to the community.  

## What Youâ€™ll Find Here  
Hereâ€™s what to expect:  
- **Development Guides**: Insights from my work in Solidity and Move.  
- **Security Insights**: Lessons from smart contract audits and protocol reviews.  
- **Blockchain Trends**: Data-driven analysis of the decentralized ecosystem.  
- **Curiosity-Driven Topics**: Anything else Iâ€™m learning and excited to share!

## Why Chaos SR?  
Before I found blockchain, I was trying out a lot of different things online, and it felt pretty chaotic. Even after discovering blockchain and falling in love with it, that sense of chaos stuck with me. "Chaos" is all about that journey. "SR" stands for Security Researcher, reflecting my focus on blockchain security and smart contract auditing now. 

## Letâ€™s Connect  
If youâ€™re a developer, researcher, or blockchain enthusiast, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!
