## Introduction
Welcome to my Rust learning journey <br>
 As I dive deeper into the world of Rust programming, I've created a series of small projects to sharpen my skills and understand the language better. Each project explores different aspects of Rust, from basic syntax to more complex concepts like memory management and concurrency. Follow along as I learn and grow through hands-on coding experiences. Check out the full details of my projects on GitHub.

## Rust Learning Projects

Embark on a journey through basic to advanced Rust concepts with these mini-projects.

- **Guessing Game :** A CLI game that generates a random number for the user to guess.
- ***Simple Calculator:*** Performs basic arithmetic operations from the command line.
- **Reverse String CLI:** Reverses a string entered by the user.
- **Natural Language Detector:** Detects the language of input text.
- **Task Manager:** A to-do list application demonstrating Rust's control flow and data structures.

## What You'll Learn
By completing these projects, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- Basic Rust syntax, including functions, variables, and loops. <br>
- Handling user input and performing error handling. <br>
- Working with Rust's memory management and ownership model. <br>
- Using libraries (e.g., rand and whatlang) to enhance functionality. <br>
- Building command-line tools with Rust, implementing structs and methods, and managing dynamic data structures like vectors.
